# Test-Tower

The mobile phones must undergo a drop resistance test and a drop resistance index is assessed before allowing them to be marketed, Testing towers are used for fall resistance tests. The height of each floor of the tower is the same. if the phone is thrown from the 7th layer and it is not broken, but the 8th layer is broken, the mobile phone withstands index=7, in particular, if the mobile phone breaks down from the first layer, the drop resistance index=0. If the Nth floor of the highest floor of the tower is not broken, then the drop resistance index = n in order to reduce the number of tests, the number of K mobile phones were sampled from each manufacturer to participate in the test. if we always adopt the best strategy, how many times do we need to test at most to determine the phone's drop resistance index under the worst luck?

Example:
Input k=1, n= 2
K refers to the number of mobile phones, 1 c- k é- 100
N refers to the number of the tower layers, 1 <E n <E 10^
• The program stops when receiving k as *-I"
Output: 2

Explanation: The mobile phone fell from the ground floor. If it is broken, the index must be 0.
Otherwise, the mobile phone will fall from the 1st floor, If it is broken, the index must be 1, if it is not
broken, then the index is 2, Therefore, in the worst case, we need to test twice to determine the
index
